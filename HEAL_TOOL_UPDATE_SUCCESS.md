# Heal Tool Update - Successfully Applied ✅

## Date: 2025-01-XX

## Problem Identified
VSCode's `replace_string_in_file` tool had a caching bug that caused silent failures:
- Tool read from stale cached content (3699 lines)
- Reported successful edits that never wrote to disk
- Actual file remained unchanged (3537 lines with old values)
- User correctly reported changes not appearing despite all troubleshooting

## Solution
Used PowerShell direct file manipulation to bypass VSCode cache and ensure actual disk writes.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Slider Enhancements ✅

**Brush Size Slider:**
- Changed min from `5` to `1` (precise 1px control)
- Changed max from `40` to `50` (larger brush option)
- Changed `onchange` to `oninput` (realtime feedback)
- Range: 1-50px

**Heal Radius Slider:**
- Changed min from `3` to `1` (precise 1px control)
- Changed max from `10` to `15` (larger healing radius)
- Changed `onchange` to `oninput` (realtime feedback)
- Range: 1-15px

**New Mask Opacity Slider:**
- Range: 10-80% (default 30%)
- Allows users to adjust red overlay visibility
- Uses `oninput` for realtime feedback

### 2. New Variables Added ✅

```javascript
let blemishMaskOpacity = 0.3;     // Mask opacity (10-80%)
let isProcessingHeal = false;     // Prevent double API calls  
let hasDrawnMask = false;         // Track if user drew anything
```

### 3. Auto-Heal on Mouse Release ✅

**Updated Functions:**

`startDrawingMask()` - Sets `hasDrawnMask = true` when drawing starts

`endDrawingMask()` - Now async function that:
- Calls `processBlemishHealingAuto()` automatically when mouse released
- Only heals if user drew something (`hasDrawnMask`)
- Prevents double processing (`isProcessingHeal`)

`processBlemishHealingAuto()` - New async function that:
- Restores original image (removes red overlay)
- Sends mask to backend for OpenCV inpainting
- Updates canvas with healed result
- Resets mask and state for next operation
- Provides user feedback with toast notifications

**User Experience:**
- Click/drag to mark blemishes (red overlay)
- Release mouse → automatic healing
- No need to press Enter anymore!

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts ✅

New `handleBlemishKeys()` function with shortcuts:

- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo (restore original image and clear mask)
- **ESC**: Clear mask (remove red overlay without healing)
- **[ key**: Decrease brush size by 2px (min 1px)
- **] key**: Increase brush size by 2px (max 50px)

Event listener added to `DOMContentLoaded`:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleBlemishKeys);
```

### 5. UI Updates ✅

**HTML Structure:**
- Added Mask Opacity slider with label and value display
- Positioned before Algorithm Selection section
- Consistent styling with other controls
- Bootstrap form-range styling applied

**Functions Added/Updated:**
- `updateBlemishOpacity(value)` - Updates opacity and display
- `processBlemishHealingAuto()` - Auto-heal logic
- `handleBlemishKeys(e)` - Keyboard shortcut handler
- `startDrawingMask(e)` - Sets drawing flag
- `endDrawingMask()` - Triggers auto-heal

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `app/templates/image.html`

### Methods Used
PowerShell commands for direct file manipulation:
1. `$content -replace` for regex replacements
2. Array slicing for inserting new content
3. `Set-Content` to write changes to disk
4. `Get-Content` and `Select-String` for verification

### Why PowerShell?
VSCode tools reported success but didn't actually write to disk due to cache mismatch. PowerShell ensures actual file system writes.

## Verification Steps

✅ Slider ranges updated (min="1" for both)
✅ Mask opacity slider inserted before Algorithm section
✅ All new variables declared
✅ `updateBlemishOpacity()` function added
✅ `processBlemishHealingAuto()` function complete
✅ `handleBlemishKeys()` function added
✅ Keyboard event listener registered
✅ `oninput` used instead of `onchange` for sliders
✅ `hasDrawnMask` flag set in `startDrawingMask()`
✅ `endDrawingMask()` made async and calls auto-heal
✅ Server restarted successfully
✅ No Python errors

## User Testing Instructions

1. **Hard refresh browser:** Ctrl+Shift+R (or Ctrl+F5)
2. **Navigate to Image Editor page**
3. **Load an image**
4. **Click Heal tool button**
5. **Test new features:**

   **Precision Control:**
   - Adjust Brush Size to 1px (minimum)
   - Adjust Heal Radius to 1px (minimum)
   - Both should allow very precise work

   **Mask Opacity:**
   - Adjust Mask Opacity slider
   - Red overlay should change transparency in realtime

   **Auto-Heal:**
   - Click or drag to mark blemishes
   - Release mouse → automatic healing (no Enter needed!)
   - Watch for toast notification

   **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Press `[` to shrink brush
   - Press `]` to grow brush
   - Press `ESC` to clear mask
   - Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo

## OpenCV Inpainting Methods

Available algorithms (selectable in UI):
- **Navier-Stokes (ns)**: Smoother, better for large areas
- **Telea**: Faster, better for small blemishes

Both use bilateral filtering for natural results.

## What Changed From Before

### OLD Behavior:
- Min brush: 5px (too large for precision)
- Min radius: 3px (too large for small blemishes)
- Had to press Enter to heal
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Fixed mask opacity
- `onchange` events (only on release)

### NEW Behavior:
- Min brush/radius: 1px (perfect precision)
- Auto-heal on mouse release
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Adjustable mask opacity
- `oninput` events (realtime feedback)
- Better UX with flags preventing double processing

---

## Performance Notes

- Auto-heal respects `isProcessingHeal` flag to prevent overlapping API calls
- Original image cached in `originalImageForBlemish` for instant undo
- Mask reset automatically after successful heal
- Toast notifications provide clear feedback

---

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requested features implemented and verified. Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5001

**Next Step:** User should hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) and test the new Heal tool features.
