/*
 * RULE TO CONTROL CARDS PER ROW USING CSS GRID
 * This is the primary rule for the view mode functionality.
 * It defines a grid layout and uses the `--cardsPerRow` variable to set the number of columns.
 * `grid-template-columns: repeat(var(...), 1fr)` is the core of the fix, ensuring
 * that the grid has exactly the specified number of columns and will wrap automatically.
*/
.mxh-cards-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--cardsPerRow, 6), 1fr);
  gap: 8px; /* Defines the space between cards */
}

/*
 * The .col class is now a grid item. `min-width: 0` is a good practice
 * to prevent grid items from overflowing if their content is too wide.

.mxh-cards-grid .col {
  min-width: 0;
